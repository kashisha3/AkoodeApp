# AkoodeApp

This chatbot application is designed to provide an interactive and personalized experience with user authentication and chat history management. Built using Python, Flask, and PyTorch, the application allows users to register and log in, ensuring that their chat sessions are secure and personalized. Once logged in, users can interact with the chatbot, and their conversations are stored in a SQLite database, enabling them to retrieve previous chats upon subsequent logins. The frontend is developed using HTML templates with Flaskâ€™s templating engine, providing a seamless user interface that includes login, registration, and chat functionalities. The chatbot's responses are generated using a neural network model trained on specific intents, making it capable of responding appropriately to various user queries.

Steps to run the program:-

-> You have to update the intents.json file with the questions and answers you want (otherwise you can use the demo dataset which has the information about a coffee shop).

-> Everytime you make changes in the intents.json file, you have to train the model again. For this please run the train.py file by typing "python train.py" in the terminal.

-> Once the model is trained, you can launch the app on the browser by running test.py file by typing "python test.py" in the terminal.

-> A link in the terminal will come which acts as a local host for running the application.

-> A login page will open. If you already have a account, please login otherwise you will have to register. If you register as a new user, your data will be saved in chatbot.db file (this is the database file).

-> Once the authentication step is complete, you can chat with the chatbot.
